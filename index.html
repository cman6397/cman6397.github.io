                <p>  I am passionate about gaming and have spent a considerable amount of time playing all kinds of games.  I have spent many hours playing computer games like Rust and Minecraft and even more time playing board games like chess and poker.  My favorite game of all time is chess and it is the only game that I still play consistently.  </p>

                <p> I discovered competitive chess my freshman year in college when a couple dormates began playing chess in the hallways.  I really enjoyed the geometry and strategy of the game and began playing regularly. I setup an online account on chess.com and started playing 10 minute games.  I settled at an initial rating of 600 which corresponded to the bottom 5th percentile of players on the site but set a long term goal to reach a 99th percentile rating of 2000.  I achieved my goal after two years and reached my peak rating of 2200 a year out of university.  At this point I was getting paired with USCF National Masters and FIDE Masters regulary and was holding my own against many of them in online games.

                </p>

                <p> Below is a game I played against National Master "finec2" on chess.com.  I am playing with the black pieces.  White resigned after 15. Nxd1+.  (<a href="https://www.chess.com/live/game/2140983944"> Game Source </a>)

                <p> I love all kinds of music and play a couple different instruments.  I have played piano since I was young and continue to practice and learn new pieces to this day.  My favorite composers are Beethoven, Rachmaninoff, and Chopin.  Some of my favorite modern artists are Seven Lions, Passion Pit, Avicii, The Kinks, David Bowie, Elliott Smith, The Zombies, The Kite String Tangle, Vance Joy, Deadmau5, and Panama. Here are clips of me playing the second movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata and Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C# Minor. </p>

                <p> I really enjoy spending time in nature.  When I was young I spent my summers canoe tripping and backpacking in Canada. When I was 14 I had a life changing experience when I visited Crestone, Colorado with my family and saw the 14ers of the Sangre de Cristo Range.  Since then I have had a fascination with mountains and have gone to hike and climb many.  I have climbed: Mount Whitney, Elbert, Massive, San Jacinto, San Gorgonio, Diablo, Hamilton, and Kilimanjaro.  Here is a photo from January 2018 when I biked up Mount Hamilton with a friend to experience snow in Santa Clara county!  You can see Lick Observatory on the left.   </p>

                    <p> In high school I was a pitcher for the varsity baseball team and an offensive and defensive tackle for the varsity football team. I was awarded first team all league honors in football and second team all league honors in baseball.  At Berkeley, I joined the club baseball team.  I finished with a 2.22 ERA and second team all region honors. I currently play summer baseball in a men's league. </p>
