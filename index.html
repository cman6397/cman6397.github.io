                <p>  I am passionate about gaming and have spent a considerable amount of time playing all kinds of games.  My favorite computer games are Rust and Minecraft and my favorite board games are chess and poker.  The game I play the most consistently is chess.  </p>

                <p> I began playing chess my sophomore year of college when I was 20 years old.  I set up an account on chess.com and began playing 10 minute games online.  I worked my way up from a 600 rating to a 2200 rating and went from the 10th percentile of players on the site to the 99.8th percentile.  Click

                <p> Below is a game I played against National Master "finec2" on chess.com.  I am playing with the black pieces.  White resigned after 15. Nxd1+.  (<a href="https://www.chess.com/live/game/2140983944"> Game Source </a>)

                <p> I love all kinds of music and play a couple different instruments.  I have played piano since I was young and continue to practice and learn new pieces to this day.  My favorite composers are Beethoven, Rachmaninoff, and Chopin.  Some of my favorite modern artists are Seven Lions, Passion Pit, Avicii, The Kinks, David Bowie, Elliott Smith, The Zombies, The Kite String Tangle, Vance Joy, Deadmau5, and Panama. Here are clips of me playing the second movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata and Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C# Minor. </p>

                <p> I really enjoy spending time in nature.  When I was young I spent my summers canoe tripping and backpacking in Canada. When I was 14 I had a life changing experience when I visited Crestone, Colorado with my family and saw the 14ers of the Sangre de Cristo Range.  Since then I have had a fascination with mountains and have gone to hike and climb many.  I have climbed: Mount Whitney, Elbert, Massive, San Jacinto, San Gorgonio, Diablo, Hamilton, and Kilimanjaro.  Here is a photo from January 2018 when I biked up Mount Hamilton with a friend to experience snow in Santa Clara county!  You can see Lick Observatory on the left.   </p>

                    <p> In high school I was a pitcher for the varsity baseball team and an offensive and defensive tackle for the varsity football team. I was awarded first team all league honors in football and second team all league honors in baseball.  At Berkeley, I joined the club baseball team.  I finished with a 2.22 ERA and second team all region honors. I currently play summer baseball in a men's league. </p>
