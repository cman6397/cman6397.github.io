    <b> Chess </b>

    <p> In 2014 I began playing online chess on chess.com after playing a couple games with friends in the dorm rooms. I wasn't very good but I really enjoyed playing and wanted to improve.  I advanced from a 600 rating to a 2200 rating which was an improvement from the 5th percentile of players on the site to the 99.8th percentile.  I now get paired with national masters and FIDE masters regularly and can hold my own against many of them in online games!

    to go to my chess.com profile.  Add me as a friend if you would like to play some games. 
    </p>

    <p> Below is a 5-minute blitz game I played against National Master finec2 (2290 USCF) on chess.com.  I am playing with the black pieces.  White resigned after 15. Nxd1+.

    <b> Other Games </b>

    <p> I have spent about 1000 hours playing games on steam. The most recent game I played was "Kona" and the game I have played the most is "Rust".  I aslo really enjoy playing poker.  I have played about 40,000 hands over Zynga Poker, games with friends, and micro stake live games.

<h3> Sports </h3> 
<div class = "chunk_container">
    <p> In high school I was a pitcher for the varsity baseball team and an offensive and defensive tackle for the varsity football team. I was awarded first team all league honors in football and second team all league honors in baseball.  At Berkeley, I joined the club baseball team.  I finished with a 2.22 ERA and second team all region honors. I currently play summer baseball in a men's league. </p>

<h3> Music </h3> 
<div class = "chunk_container">
    <p> I love all kinds of music and play a couple different instruments.  I have played piano since I was young and continue to practice and learn new pieces to this day.  My favorite composers are Beethoven, Rachmaninoff, and Chopin.  I am also a fan of a lot of modern music and have learned a couple electronic songs and rock songs. Here are clips of me playing the second movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata and Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C# Minor. </p>

<h3> Outdoors </h3> 
<div class = "chunk_container">
    <p> I really enjoy spending time in nature.  When I was young I spent my summers canoe tripping and backpacking in Canada. When I was 14 I had a life changing experience when I visited Crestone, Colorado with my family and witnessed the 14ers of the Sangre de Cristo Range first hand.  Since then I have had a fascination with mountains and have gone to hike and climb many.  I have climbed: Mount Whitney, Elbert, Massive, San Jacinto, San Gorgonio, Diablo, Hamilton, and Kilimanjaro.  Here is a photo from January 2018 when I biked up Mount Hamilton with a friend to experience snow in Santa Clara county!  You can see Lick Observatory on the left.   </p>
