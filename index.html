<b> Chess </b> 
<p> About four years ago I began playing online chess on chess.com.  Starting at a blitz elo of just 600, I climbed my way up to a 2200 rating and a 99.8th percentile site ranking.  I have held an even score against national masters for the past year.   </p>

<p> Below is a 5-minute blitz game I played against National Master finec2 (2290 USCF) on chess.com.  I am playing with the black pieces.  White resigned after 15. Nxd1.

<b> Baseball </b> 
<p> In highschool I was one of three starting pitchers for my baseball team.  I finished my senior year with a 2.72 ERA and second team all league honors.  At Berkeley I joined the club baseball team.  I finished with a 2.22 ERA and second team all region honors. I currently play in a men's league. </p>

<b> Piano </b> 
<p> I have played piano since I was young and continue to practice and learn new pieces to this day.  My favorite composers are Beethoven, Rachmaninoff, and Chopin.  I have learned several pieces from Beethoven's sonatas and some of Rachminoff's work.  I am currently learning some Scott Joplin ragtimes.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8xpUJc1088"> Here</a> is a clip of me playing the second movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata.</p>
