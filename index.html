<b> Chess </b> 
<p> About three years ago I began playing online chess on chess.com. As a beginner, I was ranked in the bottom 10 percent of players on chess.com and had an elo rating as low as 650. After many games played and lots of time spent studying chess material, I reached a highest elo of 2150 and a 99.8th percentile site ranking.  I have had many wins against national masters and Fide masters(lowest ranking masters) and even one win against a grand master! Although I still enjoy reading about chess and playing games, I don't spend as much time on it anymore because I am not improving.  </p>

<p> Below is a 5-minute blitz game I played vs National Master finec2 (2290 USCF) on chess.com.  I like this game because it was short and exciting.  I thought white was losing after ne4 but we both missed Qf3 with the idea of simultaneously taking the knight and defending the rook if Nf2+ is played.  Such is the nature of blitz chess.

<b> Baseball </b> 
<p> In highschool I was one of three starting pitchers for my baseball team.  I finished my senior year with a 2.72 ERA and second team all league honors.  At Berkeley I joined the club baseball team.  I finished with a 2.22 ERA and second team all region honors. Photos coming soon</p>

<b> Piano </b> 
<p> I have played piano since I was young and continue to practice pieces to this day.  My favorite composers are Beethoven, Rachmaninoff, and Chopin.  I have learned several pieces from Beethoven's sonatas and some of Rachminoff's work.  Links to performances coming soon </p>
