<b> Hobbies </b>

<p> About three years ago I began playing online chess on chess.com. I had played the game several times when I was young and was reexposed to it by college dorm mates. I enjoyed playing casually and wanted to improve.  As a beginner, I was ranked in the bottom 10 percent of players on chess.com and had an elo rating as low as 650.  As I began to play more frequently, I started to absorve strategy from my opponents and learn from my mistakes. In a couple months I had reached the average level of chess players on the site (1100 elo) .  My interest in chess grew and grew as I improved. I was frequently reading chess material and watching masters play on youtube.  After many games played and lots of time spent enjoying chess material, I topped out at about a 2100 elo and a 99.7th percentile site ranking.  I also have some proud wins over national masters, fide masters, international masters, and even one grand master! Although I still enjoy reading about chess and playing games, I don't spend nearly as much time on it anymore because it is not as fun to play when you know you are not improving.  </p>

<p> Below is a 5-minute blitz game I played vs National Master finec2(2290 USCF) on chess.com.  I like this game because it was short and exciting.  I thought white was busted after ne4 but we both missed Qf3 with the idea of simultaneously taking the knight and defending the rook if Nf2+ is played.  Such is the nature of blitz chess.
